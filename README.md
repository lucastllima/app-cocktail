# Drink Discover App - Nuxt 3

Welcome to the Drink Discover App! This project demonstrates how to create an application using the Nuxt 3 framework that consumes the CocktailDB API to display drink categories and drinks within each category. The app is styled using Tailwind CSS and also includes unit tests using the Vitest library.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
```

## Running Unit Tests

This project uses the Vitest library for unit testing. To run the tests, you can use the following command:

```bash
# npm
npm run test
```

## Generating Production Build

If you want to create an optimized version of the application for production, use the following command:

```bash
# npm
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized files in the dist folder, ready to be deployed to a production server.

## Styling with Tailwind CSS
The app is styled using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. You can customize the styles by editing the Tailwind configuration file and adding CSS classes in your components.

## API Integration

The app integrates with the CocktailDB API to fetch drink categories and drinks within each category.
